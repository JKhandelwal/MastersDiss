\section*{Abstract}
This senior honours project was focused on performing experiments in skate fish re-identification, to aid researchers at the Scottish Oceans Institute in their work with skate fish. The aim was to build an algorithm which could re-identify skate based on the spot patterns on their back. There were three main approaches tried: weakly supervised feature learning using an adaptation of a facial recognition neural network; supervised object detection using an object detection neural network; and keypoint matching using multiple methods of finding keypoints and matching the keypoints found. The results mainly showed that for both of the neural networks, the spot patterns were not being found or detected, thus it appeared that these approaches would not solve the problem. Spot detection as keypoints was also not successful at finding spots. However, there was success when matching hand annotated spots, and if spots can be detected more accurately, then re-identification would be achievable with this method.
