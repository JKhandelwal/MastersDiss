\section*{Abstract}
\addcontentsline{toc}{section}{Abstract}
This Masters Dissertation was focused on trying to use geopolitical events to predict changes in the stock market. This aim was to first use the Global Database for Language and Tone (GDELT) to build topic models, which organise the geopolitical news into topics which could be used as a filter for the daily news cycle. Then, using the Tone and Geopolitical conflict scores provided by GDELT, models would be made made to predict changes in the stock market. There were two main topic modelling approaches, firstly using Latent Dirichlet Allocation, and secondly using K-Means clustering with TF-IDF. Both of these approaches either were incapable, or struggled to filter unseen news effectively, which means that they would not be effective in picking up new topics. However, many different stock predictive models were tried, and it was found that the accuracy of models using the GDELT information was higher in predicting the direction the stock market would go, compared to a model which just used previous stock direction values. The best of the models also were able to demonstrate adding value to a simple portfolio, which suggests that using GDELT is a viable metric by which to predict the stock market. 
\section*{Impact of COVID-19}
The impacts of COVID-19 was minimal on this dissertation. The only issue was the amount of data used being restricted due to the machine constraints. Without Covid-19 data covering a longer time period from GDELT would have been used.
