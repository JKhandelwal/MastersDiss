\section{Existing Work}

There have been many approaches in modelling Geopolitical risk, as it remains an interesting part of modelling stock prices. 


The majority of geopol approaches use specific newspapers and work on the basis of those, such as the reference paper. 


The main part of this project was to use the GDELT database instead of just articles. The gdelt database stores the URLs, which were parsed to get the headline out of the article, and then the tone and the goldstein scores were used to attempt to predict stock shift. 


There are other approaches to predicting stock shift from the news, these mainly use sentiment analysis to aim to predict stock prices from news articles, though there is limited prior work using information at the scale of which gdelt would provide.
