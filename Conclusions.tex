\section{Further Work}

There is a large amount of further work which can be explored. One of the most apparent extensions of this would be to try these methods on more data. GDELT is a large resource, and a vast amount of data is available to be explored and tried, from data from multiple other countries, to using more historical long term data.


One of the biggest challenges with this work is that it only works on a single word basis. All of the clusters etc are based on single words, and not phrases, or content. This means there would still have to be a large amount of manual work required when using this approach, to ensure that the algorithms do not end up working with incoherence. The principle of garbage in garbage out also applies here, there is a substantial amount of preprocessing required to ensure that you're feeding the algorithm useful information, and even after that,

Another further exploration could be an attempt to predict the stock prices directly, this work only aimed to predict changes in stock, and as a result this doesn't take magnitude of change into consideration, a large stock fall is the same as a small stock fall, but investor reactions may be different if it is only a minor fall in the market, and
