\section{Initial Experiment}
The initial experiment was split into 2 parts, firstly to build a topic model which could be capable of working as required to filter out irrelevant data, and the second part which was to build modelling strategies on a manually filtered out dataset. These 2 approaches were run concurrently for time management sake. The aim would then be to combine the approaches, on a different dataset, and then use that to create an accuracy metric for how valid the 2 models tried were.


One of the biggest issues faced is that all of this works on a word by word basis thus context can often be lost trying to model topics.
