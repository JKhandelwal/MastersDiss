\section{Scope}
GDELT is a massive resource, which accumulates vast quantities of data every second. Thus, due to this being a Masters dissertation, the scope was restricted. The initial prototype modelled data which was focused on the period between the 1st of March and the 30th of April, and was focussed on attempting to predict against the Dow Jones.

The predictions were used for the consecutive values, using the topic model.
