\section{Scope}

GDELT is a large resource which accumulates vast quantities of data each day, thus by necessity, the scope of the dissertation has to be restricted. There were several initial approaches, firstly looking at one day's data on GDELT, and one article to test out and try the topic modelling approaches. 

The final data which was tested was the time period between the 1st of March 2020 and the 30th of April 2020 (inclusive). To try to curate the topic model, the GDELT filtering system was used, to only look at USA/China related media. 

The stock market which was used was the Dow Jones Index, which measures the stock performance of 30 companies on US stock markets. This was used as it was thought that this would give the best potential correlation between the GDELT data and stock change. 

\subsection{Code and Language}
The results and code for this dissertation were all written in the python programming language. This was chosen as there were many existing libraries for the algorithms used in this dissertation, along with significant support for building classification models.

\subsection{Impact of COVID19}
The impacts of Covid\-19 was minimal on this dissertation. The only issue was the that I was restricted on the amount of data used. I would have used more data time wise on GDELT to test my data on.
